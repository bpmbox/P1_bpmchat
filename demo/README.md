## This project was generated by [Flatlogic generator](https://flatlogic.com/generator).


  - Frontend: [React.js](https://flatlogic.com/templates?framework%5B%5D=react&sort=default)
  
  - Design: [Flatlogic One](https://flatlogic.com/templates?design%5B%5D=flatlogic&sort=default)
  
  - Backend: Laravel
  
  - Database: mySQL


## To start the project:

### Backend:

  First, run the development server:

  ```bash
  composer install
  ```

  Copy file ".env.example" and change name to ".env" and input database|mail config

  ```bash
  php artisan key:generate
  php artisan jwt:secret
  php artisan migrate
  php artisan db:seed
  php artisan serve --host=localhost --port=8080
  ```

### Frontend:

#### Run `yarn install`

This will install both run-time project dependencies and developer tools listed
in [package.json](package.json) file.

#### Run `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. Whenever you modify any of the source files inside the `/src` folder,
the module bundler ([Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)) will recompile the
app on the fly and refresh all the connected browsers.

#### Run `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!


## To start the project with Docker:
  ## Description:

  - The project contains `docker-compose.yml` and a couple of helper scripts:

  - `docker-compose.yml` (all our services: web, backend, db are described here)
  - `start-backend.sh` (starts nodejs app)
  - `wait-for-it.sh` (imported from https://github.com/vishnubob/wait-for-it)

  ## Run services:

  1. Install docker compose (https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

  2. Move to `docker` folder. All next steps should be done from this folder.
  - `cd docker`

  3. Make executables from `wait-for-it.sh` and `start-backend.sh`:
  - `chmod +x start-backend.sh && chmod +x wait-for-it.sh`


  4. Download dependend projects for services. In our case wee also need `singup-react`.

  5. Review the docker-compose.yml file. Make sure that all services have Dockerfiles. Only db service doesn't require a Dockerfile. I've created docker branches for user-management-template-backend and sing-app-react projects. You should switch to them before running `docker-compose up`.

  6. Make sure you have needed ports (see them in `ports`) available on your local machine.

  7. Start services:
  - With an empty database `rm -rf data && docker-compose up`
  - With a stored (from previus runs) database data `docker-compose up`

  8. Check http://localhost:3000

  9. Stop services:
  - Just press `Ctr+C`
